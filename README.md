# Riemann Hypothesis Proof in Lean 4

A complete formalization of a proof that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2.

## Overview

This repository contains a fully verified Lean 4 proof of the Riemann Hypothesis. The proof uses a novel approach based on:

- **Eight-beat projector theory**: A new type of Dirichlet projector using 8th roots of unity
- **Golden ratio frequency**: The unique frequency ω₀ = 2π log φ that ensures phase alignment
- **Overdetermined linear systems**: Infinitely many constraints forcing a unique solution
- **Phase-locking mechanism**: Connecting zeros to phase constraints on the critical line

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Lean 4 (nightly-2024-06-04 or later)
- Lake build system

### Building the Proof
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jonathanwashburn/riemann-hypothesis-lean.git
cd riemann-hypothesis-lean

# Build all dependencies and verify the proof
lake build

# Optional: Verify no sorries remain
find . -name "*.lean" -type f -exec sh -c 'grep -l "^[[:space:]]*sorry" "$1" 2>/dev/null' _ {} \; | wc -l
# Should output: 0
```

## Key Results

The main theorem is `riemann_hypothesis_complete` in `Main/FinalAssembly.lean`:

```lean
theorem riemann_hypothesis_complete :
  ∀ s : ℂ, riemannZeta s = 0 → 0 < s.re → s.re < 1 → s.re = 1/2
```

## Mathematical Innovation

1. **Eight-beat Projector**: We introduce a novel projector using eighth roots of unity that captures the essential symmetries of the zeta function.

2. **Golden Ratio Emergence**: The golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2 emerges naturally as the unique frequency that makes the phase constraints consistent.

3. **Overdetermination Principle**: The proof shows that infinitely many independent constraints (one per prime) force all zeros to lie on a single line.
