/-! # The Deep Connection -/

/-- Eight = 2³ connects to:
  - Binary structure (debits/credits)
  - Cubic lattice of space (Recognition Science)
  - Octave in music (frequency doubling)

  The eight-beat structure emerges from the intersection of:
  1. Algebraic necessity (roots of unity sum to zero)
  2. Optimization (golden ratio minimizes cost)
  3. Recognition Science (8-beat cosmic rhythm)
