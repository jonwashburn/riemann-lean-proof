  -- The eight-beat projector is defined as:
  -- P(z) = (1/8) ∑ₖ eighth_root(k) * F(z + ik·ω₀/(2π))
  -- where F involves the logarithmic derivative

  -- When ζ(s) = 0, the log derivative -ζ'/ζ has a pole at s
  -- The k-th term of the projector samples at z + ik·ω₀/(2π)
  -- So when z = s, this term has a pole at s + ik·ω₀/(2π)

  -- More precisely: The k-th summand has the form
  -- eighth_root(k) * log_deriv(z + ik·ω₀/(2π))

  -- Since log_deriv has a pole at s, this summand has a pole when
  -- z + ik·ω₀/(2π) = s, i.e., when z = s - ik·ω₀/(2π)

  -- But we want to show the projector has a pole at s + ik·ω₀/(2π)
  -- This requires a more careful analysis...

  -- Actually, let's think differently: If ζ has a zero at s,
  -- then each shifted point s + ik·ω₀/(2π) contributes to the projector
  -- The contribution from the j-th term at the k-th shifted point is complex

  -- For a meromorphic function with controlled poles,
  -- the weighted sum of residues must vanish

  intro h_merom
  -- This follows from the principle that the eight-beat projector
  -- must not introduce new poles beyond those expected
  -- The only way this can happen is if residues cancel

  -- Use Agent D's eighth_roots_sum = 0 result
  have h_sum : ∑ k : Fin 8, eighth_root k = 0 := eighth_roots_sum

  -- Apply meromorphic residue theorem

  -- Key insight: The eight-beat projector is designed to be meromorphic
  -- This means that any potential poles must have residues that cancel

  -- The projector has the form:
  -- P(s) = (1/8) ∑ₖ eighth_root(k) * F(s + ik·ω₀/(2π))
  -- where F involves terms like log(p)·p^(-s)

  -- For a specific prime p, the contribution is:
  -- ∑ₖ eighth_root(k) * log(p)·p^(-(s + ik·ω₀/(2π)))

  -- If there's a pole at some s₀, the residue from prime p is:
  -- ∑ₖ eighth_root(k) * Res[log(p)·p^(-z), s₀ + ik·ω₀/(2π)]

  -- For the projector to be meromorphic (no new poles), this sum must be zero

  -- This is a consequence of the Mittag-Leffler theorem:
  -- To construct a meromorphic function with prescribed poles,
  -- the residues must satisfy certain compatibility conditions

  -- In our case, the eight-fold symmetry and eighth_roots_sum = 0
  -- ensure these conditions are met

  -- Apply the principle: If f is meromorphic and has potential poles
  -- at {s + ik·ω₀/(2π) : k ∈ Fin 8} with residues rₖ,
  -- and if ∑ₖ eighth_root(k)·rₖ ≠ 0, then the linear combination

    -- Wait, we need to be more careful. The residue comes from
