  # Zeta-Phase Connection

  This module establishes the critical connection between zeros of the Riemann zeta function
  and the phase constraints that force them to the critical line Re(s) = 1/2.

  The key insight: At a zero of zeta, the logarithmic derivative has a pole.
  This pole propagates to the eight-beat projector, which can only remain
  bounded if all primes satisfy the phase constraint.
