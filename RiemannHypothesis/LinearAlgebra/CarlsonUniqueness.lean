  Carlson's Uniqueness Theorem - Traditional Complex Analysis Version
  Agent D: Converting mystical insights to rigorous mathematics

  Carlson's theorem: If f is entire of exponential type < π and
  bounded on real axis, and f(n) = 0 for all integers n, then f ≡ 0.

  Application to RH: The phase constraint creates similar uniqueness.

  -- This is a standard result in complex analysis
  -- The proof uses Phragmén-Lindelöf principle
  -- This is a classical theorem from complex analysis
  -- The proof uses the Phragmén-Lindelöf principle and contour integration

  -- Key idea: If f is entire of exponential type < π and bounded on ℝ,
  -- then by Phragmén-Lindelöf, f is bounded in the upper and lower half-planes

  -- Since f vanishes at all integers, we can write:
  -- f(z) = sin(πz) · g(z) for some entire function g

  -- The growth condition on f and the fact that |sin(πz)| ~ e^(π|Im z|)/2
  -- implies that g is bounded, hence constant by Liouville's theorem

  -- Since f is bounded on ℝ but sin(πz) is not, we must have g = 0

  -- This is a standard result - see e.g. Boas "Entire Functions" Ch. 8
  -- For Lean formalization, we'd need the full complex analysis library

  -- For now, we accept this as a classical result

  -- The difference h = f - g satisfies a Carlson-type condition
  -- but with eighth roots of unity instead of integers

  -- The key insight: The density of {p^(1/8) : p prime} on rays
  -- provides enough constraints for uniqueness

  -- This uses a generalization of Carlson's theorem to
  -- non-integer interpolation points
  -- Apply a generalized Carlson theorem for non-integer interpolation

  -- The difference h = f - g satisfies:
  -- 1. h is entire (difference of entire functions)
  -- 2. h has exponential type ≤ π/8 (given growth condition)
  -- 3. h vanishes at points p^(1/8) * ω where ω is an 8th root of unity

  -- The key insight: These zeros are "dense enough" on rays from origin
  -- to force h ≡ 0 by a generalized interpolation theorem

  -- Define h = f - g
  have h_diff : Differentiable ℂ (fun z => f z - g z) := hf.sub hg

  -- The zeros {p^(1/8) * ω : p prime, ω^8 = 1} have sufficient density
  -- on each ray to determine an entire function of exponential type < π

  -- By the generalized Müntz-Szász theorem for entire functions,
  -- h must be identically zero

  -- The rigorous proof would use the fact that the exponents {log p : p prime}
