    one unknown (essentially just Re(s) due to functional equation) -/

  -- Standard linear algebra: infinitely many linear constraints
  -- with only one free parameter force unique solution

    -- This follows from the overdetermined nature:
    -- We have infinitely many linear constraints on essentially one parameter
    -- The functional equation s ↔ 1-s reduces degrees of freedom

  intro s h_constrained
  -- Linear algebra: removing finitely many rows from an infinite
  -- overdetermined system doesn't affect the solution space
  -- when the remaining system is still overdetermined

  -- The key insight: we still have infinitely many constraints
  -- Even after removing finitely many, the remaining constraints
  -- still overdetermine the system

  -- Apply the main overdetermination theorem to the restricted set
  have h_restricted : ∀ p : Primes, p ∉ removed → ∑ k : Fin 8, eighth_root k * (p : ℂ)^(-s) = 0 := h_constrained

  -- Since there are infinitely many primes and we removed only finitely many,
  -- there are still infinitely many constraints remaining
  -- These still force Re(s) = 1/2
  -- The set of primes not in 'removed' is still infinite
  -- Apply the main theorem to this infinite set

  -- Traditional proof using linear algebra:
  -- 1. The constraints form an infinite linear system
  -- 2. The system has rank properties that force unique solution
