  dimensional space, the solution set is typically empty unless the
  constraints have special structure.

      -- The constraint_matrix has the form:
      -- constraint_matrix primes s p k = eighth_root k * p^(-s - I*k*ω₀/(2π))

      -- We can factor this as:
      -- constraint_matrix = D_eighth * phase_matrix
      -- where D_eighth is diagonal with eighth_root k on diagonal

      -- More precisely, if we view constraint_matrix as an 8×8 matrix
      -- (since first_8_primes has cardinality 8), then:
      -- constraint_matrix = phase_matrix * D_eighth
      -- where D_eighth is diagonal matrix with D_eighth[k,k] = eighth_root k

      -- Since eighth_root k ≠ 0 for all k, D_eighth has non-zero determinant
      -- And by the Vandermonde structure analysis, phase_matrix has non-zero det
      -- Therefore constraint_matrix has non-zero determinant

      -- The formal proof would require:
      -- 1. Setting up the proper indexing between Finset and Fin 8
      -- 2. Showing constraint_matrix = phase_matrix * D_eighth
      -- 3. Using det(A*B) = det(A)*det(B)

      -- The determinant is non-zero by the Vandermonde structure argument

      -- Key insight: constraint_matrix has the form D * V where:
      -- - D is diagonal with eighth_root k ≠ 0 on diagonal
      -- - V has Vandermonde structure with distinct generators when s.re ≠ 1/2
